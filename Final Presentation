Describe project experience including each phase of the SDLC (Requirements, Design, Implementation & Test) and the project artifacts (design documents, requirements trace, test reports...)
# What technologies did you integrate?
Visual studios MVC core to be exact

# What are paths that you explored?
I didnt really strive from the path that was given to us

# What are some future development ideas?
* Admin tools
* Rating System
to name a few

# what did you do right?
What did I do right. Thats a good question because I feel like I  didn't do anything right. But if I were to name a couple of thing I would say that the models where done correctly that thats about all. 
# what did you do wrong?
EVERYTHING. Literally EVERYTHING. I could get my database to migrat, I had to restart my project a couple hundred times, I had more red squiggly red lines then there is squiggly red lines in the world. IT WAS HAYNES
# where were you lucky?
No everything that could of gone wrong did
# what would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?
From my experience nothing. Even though I was either late or never here I learned alot from the indivduals around me. I feel like I have a clear understanding on what programming really is.... A huge pain in the A$$.

Now from the beginning of my project to the end.
* Commit to ONE project and stick with it
* Really understand MVC
* Ask for help
